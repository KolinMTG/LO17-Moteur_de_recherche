# LO17 Project - Search Engine

This project aims to explore various information retrieval techniques by developing a search engine capable of querying a database of scientific articles using natural language queries.  
It is part of the LO17 course at the University of Technology of CompiÃ¨gne (UTC) and was conducted through six separate practical sessions, from TD2 to TD7.

## Project Structure

The project contains several folders.

### `src/` Folder  
This folder contains all the **source files** of the project, including:

- `main_demo.py` (args: input_folder): **Main script to run first**. It automatically generates the files needed for the search engine to function properly, which are then stored in the `data/` folder.
- `moteur.py`: Allows performing searches directly via the command line without using the graphical interface. However, it is recommended to use the graphical interface for ease of use.
- `MainWindow.py`: Contains the code for the search engine's user interface (UI).
- `TD2.py` to `TD7.py`: Files corresponding to the **practical sessions**, each containing the code specific to a particular learning stage.
- `asset/`: Directory containing graphical resources used for the user interface (images, icons, etc.).

### `data/` Folder
This folder contains the **files automatically generated** by running `main_demo.py`. These files are essential for the proper functioning of the search engine.

### `BULLETINS/` Folder  
This folder must be added at the root of the project. It is not provided with the rest of the files due to its large size.

### `Documents/` Folder
This folder contains all additional project documents, including the **project report** in PDF format.  
It also includes an `Illustrations` folder that contains various figures useful for understanding the project, as well as images included in the report but in higher resolution.

## Working Environment

The project is compatible with Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS.

The project was developed and fully tested with **Python 3.9.13**. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Here is a list of the main Python libraries used in this project:

**IMPORTANT**: The SpaCy models used are the small and large French models named `fr_core_news_sm` and `fr_core_news_lg`. They must be installed together with SpaCy for proper program functionality.  
Use the following commands:  
```bash
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_lg
```

## Getting Started

> **IMPORTANT**: All functions must be run from the `src` folder to ensure proper handling of relative paths.

Follow these steps for a complete test of the project:  
1. Clone the repository into the folder of your choice (if needed).  
2. **IMPORTANT**: Add the `BULLETINS` folder containing the scientific articles in ".htm" format to the project root.  
3. Run the `_demo_.py` file to generate the `data/` folder, specifying the `input_folder` argument with the target `BULLETINS` path. For example, try the command:  
   `python main.py --input_folder BULLETINS_DEMO`  
   *(This step may take a few minutes.)*  
4. Use `moteur.py` to enter a query and search for the corresponding articles.  
5. Use `MainWindow.py` to launch the graphical interface and perform searches in a more user-friendly way.  

**Note:**  
Running `main_demo.py` generates a copy of the `data/` folder called `data_test/`. Afterwards, the program uses the pre-generated `data/` folder to avoid potential bugs related to data generation.  
This ensures that, in case of a generation failure, the search engine and graphical interface can still be used. The `data/` and `data_test/` folders are completely identical.
